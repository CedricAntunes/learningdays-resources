## EGAP

```{r egap-logo, echo=FALSE, out.width='32.8%', fig.show='hold',fig.cap=''}
knitr::include_graphics("../Images/egap-logo.png")
```

*Mission Statement: EGAP is a cross-disciplinary network of researchers and practitioners united by a focus on experimental research and dedicated to generating and disseminating rigorous evidence on topics of governance, politics, and institutions. We seek to forge partnerships between researchers and practitioners committed to understanding the politics of global development, advance evidence-based policy making, and improve the quality of empirical research in the social sciences.*

## Priorities of the EGAP Network

- Linking research and practice on topics related to governance, politics, institutions, and the political economy of development more generally
- Improving experimental methods and making innovation more accessible
- Fostering policy-relevant knowledge accumulation
- Building research capacity in the Global South

```


## Fostering Knowledge Accumulation

- The Metaketa Initiative is a collaborative research model aimed at improving policy-relevant knowledge accumulation from field experimental research
- Current clusters of studies:
    - Information and Political Accountability [results avail.]
    - Taxation [in progress]
    - Natural Resource Governance [in progress]
    - Community Policing [in progress]
    - Political Participation in Hybrid Regimes [in progress]

- Typically one slide per instructor, with a few images on a recent topic
- Try to pick a topic you will be referring back to during the week when discussing examples of design properties
