<p><strong>Background:</strong> The following example is a stylized example set of data from a hypothetical randomized experiment. In this experiment, we are evaluating the impact of participating in a workshop on experiments on number of hours per week devoted to implementing experiments. Treatment consisted of participation in a workshop like this one. Below are the outcomes we collected.</p>

<p><strong>Explanation of Data Table:</strong> We are going to reshape our data into a different format for the purposes of this exercise. The following table is a table of “potential outcomes,” which means that each individual has theoretically two potential outcomes. We know what individual 1’s potential outcome is for receiving the control condition, but we have no way of knowing what individual 1’s outcome would have been had it received the treatment condition. Y(C) refers to the potential outcome for a control condition and Y(T) refers to the potential outcome for a treatment condition. As you can see, in individual 1, we observed the Y(C) of 15, but we do not know what individual 1’s Y(T) is.</p>

<li><p>Now, we want to see what the average treatment effect would be if we assign treatment to a different pair of individuals.

We have to make a hypothesis about what these values are. Let’s write a very common “sharp” null hypothesis: the treatment has no effect for any individual. In other words, the potential outcomes Y(T) are the same as the potential outcomes Y(C). Record these in the following table.</p></li>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">0.1</span> <strong>Main Points to Remember About Hypothesis Testing</strong></h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Hypothesis testing is a calculation of the probability that we can reject stated hypotheses about our treatment effect. This provides us with a means of characterizing our certainty that an estimated treatment effect approximates the true treatment effect.</li>
<li>The most common hypothesis that we test is the sharp null hypothesis, which states that the treatment had absolutely no effect on any individual unit. To test this hypothesis, we calculate the probability that we could have observed the treatment effect we did if the treatment in reality had no effect whatsoever. This probability is known as a p-value. For example, a p-value of .05 is interpreted as a 5% chance that we could observe a treatment effect at least as large as the one we found if the treatment in fact had no effect.</li>
<li>It is conventional that p-values of .05 or lower are “significant.” This is an arbitrary cutoff, but it is so widely used in statistics that any study that fails to recover a p-value of less than .1 will report that the treatment effect is null. Nonetheless, also make sure to interpret the substance and magnitude of the treatment effect, and avoid focusing solely on statistical significance.</li>
<li>Type I error is when you reject the null hypothesis when it is actually true. In other words, you conclude that the treatment did have an effect, when in reality, it did not. The significance level can also be interpreted as the probability that we are committing Type I error. (Type II error is when you accept the null hypothesis when it is actually false, in other words, you conclude a null effect when one actually existed.)</li>
<li>Randomization inference enables us to calculate what the observed treatment effect would have been in every possible randomization of the experiment if we hypothesize that no subject responded to the treatment (our null hypothesis). From this, we can calculate the probability that we would have observed our treatment effect if the true treatment effect was actually zero. If this is a very low probability, then we have more confidence in the significance of our findings from the single randomization we actually observed.</li>
