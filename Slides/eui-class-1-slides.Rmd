# Research questions, theories, and research designs

## What makes a research question good?

- The answer to a good research question should produce knowledge that people
  will care about. 
  
- Addressing the question should (help) solve a problem, (help) make a decision, or
  clarify/challenge our understanding of/explanations about the world.

- That is, a good question arises in the context of a theory and in the context of values.

- But an interesting question is not enough.

## We also need a good research design

 - A good research design is a practical plan for research that makes the best
  use of available resources and produces a credible answer.

 - The quality of a research design can be assessed by how well it produces
  results that can be used to guide policy and improve science: 
  
    - A great research design produces results that clearly point in certain
      directions that we care about.
    
    - A poor research design produces results that leave us in the dark ---
      results with confusing interpretation, ambiguity in interpretation.

 - The point of most social and behavioral science experimental research design is to learn
   about theory not about the world per se.

## The importance of theory {.allowframebreaks}

All research design involves theory, whether implicit or explicit.

 - **Why do the research?** We have implicit theories and values which guide the
   questions we ask. Our questions are value laden: For example, social
   scientists studied marijuana use in the 1950s as a form of "deviance", the
   questions focused on "why are people making such bad decisions?" or "how can
   policy makers prevent marijuana use?" (see @howardsbecker1998a).
   
 - **Why do the research?** We might want to change how scientists explain the world
  and/or change the policy decisions in (a) one place and time and/or (b) in
  other places and times.
  
 - Research focused on learning the causal effect of $X$ on $Y$ requires a model
  of the world: *how* might intervention $X$ might have an effect on some
  outcome $Y$, and *why*, and *how large* might be the effect?  It helps us
  think about how a different intervention or targeting different recipients
  might lead to different results.

 - Designing research will often clarify where we are less certain about our
  theories.  Our theories will point to problems with our design. And questions
  arising from the process of design may indicate a need for more work on
  explanation and mechanism.

## Designing or selecting your treatment 

- Your treatment and control need to clearly connect to your
  research question.
  
- The treatment you're interested in might be a bundle of multiple components.
  If your research question is about one specific component, then the control
  should be different from the treatment in just that component.  Everything
  else should be the same.
  
## An example

A campaign where someone visits a home to talk with a family for 15 minutes to
share health information.

  - If you're interested in the effect of the specific information, then your
      control should still have all the other components (home visit with 15
      minutes duration, similar visitor, etc.) but have different information.
      This design will not teach you about the effect of visits, just about the
      effect of information.

  - If your question focuses on the effect of visits, then you need a control
      group without a visit.  But this design will not do a good job answering
      specific questions about information (visits and information are
      bundled together).

## Interpretation 

- Sometimes it's not possible to separate out a specific component of your
  treatment.  
  
- For example, your partner community health organization that visits homes may
  not be interested in visiting homes and sharing non-health information. Then your
  control might be no visit.

- You must be careful to interpret your effects as the effect of the
  information delivered in this particular way.

- You will not be able to conclude that you have estimated the effect of only
  the information. 
  
    - This might be fine for certain policy purposes: maybe the policy question
      is about the visits as an implicit bundle of treatments. 
    
    - But it is difficult to interpret the results of this design as telling us
      something clear about information alone.)


## The Research Process: Questions, theory, and credibility

 - Research starts with our values and theories about how the world works.
 
 - It continues by articulating questions that can be clearly addressed by observation (in this course, using randomized experimentation).

 - Good questions have consequential answers: changing scientific explanations, changing policy decisions.

 - Good designs tick all the boxes and give readers reason to believe the results.

# Experiments and the Counterfactual Approach to Causal Inference

## Experiments and Counterfactual Causal Inference

\includegraphics[width=.6\textwidth]{Images/MorrowPlots.jpg}

## Did the fertilizer cause more corn to grow?

Each plot either receives the fertilizer or status quo.

What does it mean for fertilizer to **cause** more corn to grow?

One useful way to think about it: if the plot of land had not received fertilizer, then less corn would have grown.

## "X causes Y" is a claim about what didn't happen

- In the counterfactual approach: "If X had not occurred, then Y would not have occurred."

- Experiments help us learn about counterfactual and manipulation-based claims about causation.

- It's not wrong to _conceptualize_ "cause" in another way (for example, whenever I see fertilized fields, I expect more corn.). But it has been productive to work in this counterfactual framework [@brady2008causation].


## How to interpret "X causes Y" in this approach

1.  "X causes Y" need not imply that other variables W and V do not cause Y: X is a part of the story, not the whole story. (The whole story is not necessary in order to learn about whether X causes Y).

2.  "X causes Y" requires a **context**: matches cause flame but require oxygen; small classrooms improve test scores but require experienced teachers and funding [@cartwright2012evidence].

3. "X causes Y" can mean "With X, the probability of Y is higher than would be without X." or "Without X there is no Y." Either is compatible with the counterfactual idea.

4.  It is not necessary to know the mechanism to establish that X causes Y. The mechanism can be complex, and it can involve probability: X causes Y sometimes because of A and sometimes because of B.


## Exercise: Colds and Honey

- Your friend says drinking honey water reduces the duration of colds.

- If we take a counterfactual approach, what does this statement implicitly
  claim about the counterfactual? 

- If we saw that people who drank honey water also tended to have shorter
   colds, would that confirm the causal claim? What other counterfactuals might
   be possible and why?
